# Benchmarking AWS Endpoints

This guide walks you through benchmarking inference endpoints protected by AWS IAM authentication. AIPerf signs every request with your AWS credentials automatically -- you just need to tell it your AWS region and service name.

## What's Supported

SigV4 signing works with AWS endpoints that speak the OpenAI API format. Here's what works today:

| Scenario | Non-Streaming | Streaming | Notes |
|----------|:---:|:---:|-------|
| API Gateway + vLLM/TGI/NIM | Yes | Yes | Full support -- standard HTTP + SSE |
| SageMaker + vLLM/LMI container | Yes | No | Non-streaming only. SageMaker uses proprietary event framing instead of SSE. |
| Bedrock Converse / InvokeModel | No | No | Different request/response schema -- not OpenAI-compatible |

## Before You Start

1. Install the AWS extra (this pulls in `botocore` for credential handling):

```bash
uv pip install aiperf[aws]
```

2. Make sure your AWS credentials are working:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If that prints your account and role info, you're good to go. If not, see [Setting Up Credentials](#setting-up-credentials).

## Quick Start

The key flags are `--auth-type sigv4`, `--aws-region`, and `--aws-service`. Add these to any `aiperf profile` command and AIPerf will sign every request automatically.

### API Gateway with IAM Auth

Your API Gateway fronts an OpenAI-compatible server and has IAM authorization enabled. Both streaming and non-streaming work:

```bash
aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v1 \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --streaming \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-east-1 \
    --aws-service execute-api \
    --request-count 100
```

If your API Gateway maps a custom path to the backend, use `--endpoint` to set it:

```bash
aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com \
    --endpoint /prod/inference/v1/chat/completions \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --streaming \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-east-1 \
    --aws-service execute-api \
    --request-count 100
```

### SageMaker with vLLM or LMI (Non-Streaming)

SageMaker endpoints running vLLM or DJL LMI containers accept OpenAI-format request bodies through the `/invocations` path. The response body is passed through unchanged, so non-streaming works. Use `--endpoint` to set the SageMaker invocation path:

```bash
aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://runtime.sagemaker.us-east-1.amazonaws.com \
    --endpoint /endpoints/my-endpoint/invocations \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-east-1 \
    --aws-service sagemaker \
    --request-count 100
```

Streaming is not supported for SageMaker endpoints because SageMaker uses a proprietary event stream format instead of SSE. Do not pass `--streaming` with SageMaker.

## Figuring Out Your Region and Service Name

The `--aws-region` should match the region in your endpoint URL:

```
https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/...
                           ^^^^^^^^^
                           this is your --aws-region
```

The `--aws-service` depends on which AWS service handles your traffic:

| If your traffic goes through... | Use `--aws-service` |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| API Gateway | `execute-api` |
| SageMaker Runtime | `sagemaker` |

A common gotcha: the service name isn't always what you'd guess. For example, it's `sagemaker` not `sagemaker-runtime`. If you get a "SignatureDoesNotMatch" error, the service name is the first thing to double-check.

## Setting Up Credentials

If `aws sts get-caller-identity` already works, you can skip this section -- AIPerf will pick up the same credentials automatically.

### Environment Variables (simplest)

Good for quick local testing:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIA..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="wJal..."
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="FwoG..."  # only if using temporary credentials

aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v1 \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-east-1 \
    --aws-service execute-api \
    --request-count 100
```

### Named Profiles (multiple accounts)

If you work with more than one AWS account, you probably already have profiles set up in `~/.aws/credentials`. Point AIPerf at the right one with `--aws-profile`:

```bash
aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://abc123.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/v1 \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-west-2 \
    --aws-service execute-api \
    --aws-profile staging \
    --request-count 100
```

Without `--aws-profile`, AIPerf uses whichever credentials the AWS CLI would use by default (environment variables first, then `[default]` profile, then IAM roles).

### SSO

If your team uses AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO), log in first, then pass the profile:

```bash
aws sso login --profile my-sso-profile

aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v1 \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-east-1 \
    --aws-service execute-api \
    --aws-profile my-sso-profile \
    --request-count 100
```

### Kubernetes (EKS)

On EKS, credentials are typically injected into your pod automatically via IRSA or Pod Identity. You don't need `--aws-profile` -- just make sure your pod's service account has the right IAM role attached:

```bash
aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v1 \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-east-1 \
    --aws-service execute-api \
    --request-count 1000
```

One thing to watch: if your pod has `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` set as an environment variable (e.g., from a Kubernetes Secret), that takes priority over IRSA/Pod Identity. If you're hitting the wrong account, check for stale env vars.

## Long-Running Benchmarks

AIPerf refreshes AWS credentials automatically before each request. This means temporary credentials (from SSO, assumed roles, or IRSA) won't expire mid-benchmark. If you're running a long benchmark with thousands of requests, you don't need to do anything special.

The one exception: if your SSO session itself expires (they typically last 8-12 hours), you'll need to re-run `aws sso login` and restart the benchmark.

## Examples

### High-Throughput API Gateway with Warmup

```bash
aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v1 \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --streaming \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-east-1 \
    --aws-service execute-api \
    --request-rate 50 \
    --request-count 1000 \
    --warmup-request-count 20
```

### Multiple API Gateway Endpoints

Distribute load across two endpoints in the same region:

```bash
aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v1 \
    --url https://def456.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v1 \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --streaming \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-east-1 \
    --aws-service execute-api \
    --request-count 500
```

### SageMaker with Custom Dataset

```bash
aiperf profile \
    --model my-model \
    --url https://runtime.sagemaker.us-west-2.amazonaws.com \
    --endpoint /endpoints/my-endpoint/invocations \
    --endpoint-type chat \
    --auth-type sigv4 \
    --aws-region us-west-2 \
    --aws-service sagemaker \
    --dataset prompts.jsonl \
    --dataset-type single_turn
```

## Troubleshooting

### "SignatureDoesNotMatch"

This is the most common error. Check these in order:

1. **Is `--aws-region` correct?** It must match the region in the URL.
2. **Is `--aws-service` correct?** See the [service name table](#figuring-out-your-region-and-service-name) above. The names aren't always obvious.
3. **Is your system clock accurate?** AWS rejects signatures that are more than 5 minutes off. Docker containers and VMs are especially prone to clock drift. Run `date -u` and compare to actual UTC.

### "The security token included in the request is expired"

Your temporary credentials have expired. Re-authenticate:

```bash
# For SSO
aws sso login --profile my-profile

# For assumed roles, this usually resolves itself --
# botocore refreshes automatically if the source credentials are still valid
```

### "No AWS credentials found"

AIPerf can't find any credentials. Verify with:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If that also fails, you need to set up credentials -- see [Setting Up Credentials](#setting-up-credentials).

### "SigV4 auth requires botocore"

Install the AWS extra:

```bash
uv pip install aiperf[aws]
```
