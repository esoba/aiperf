"""Clock offset tracking for cross-machine time synchronization.

In Kubernetes deployments, TimingManager (controller pod) and Workers (worker pods)
run on different machines with potentially different clocks. This module tracks the
clock offset between them using credit timestamps as a synchronization signal.

Each credit carries ``issued_at_ns`` (controller wall clock). When the worker receives
the credit, it computes ``sample = T2 - T1`` where T2 is the worker's wall clock.
Because this is a one-way measurement, every sample includes network transit time
as positive bias: ``sample = clock_skew + network_transit``.

Minimum offset filtering (inspired by NTP's clock filter algorithm, RFC 5905) takes
the smallest sample in a sliding window. The minimum has the least network delay,
making it the closest approximation to the true clock skew.

Both the controller (CreditIssuer) and this tracker use a dual-clock bootstrap pattern:
capture ``time.time_ns()`` once at startup as a wall-clock anchor, then derive all
subsequent timestamps from ``time.perf_counter_ns()`` deltas. This makes both sides
immune to NTP step corrections during the benchmark while keeping timestamps in the
wall-clock domain for cross-machine comparison.

An optional pre-flight RTT measurement (ping/pong probes) establishes baseline
network latency at startup, allowing the offset to be decomposed into estimated
clock skew and network transit for diagnostics.

    """Tracks clock offset between controller and worker using minimum offset filtering.

    Uses a sliding window of recent offset measurements and selects the minimum
    as the best estimate of clock skew. This rejects network jitter (which only
    adds positive bias) rather than averaging it in.

    Timestamps are derived from a wall-clock anchor captured once at initialization
    plus ``perf_counter_ns`` deltas, matching the pattern used by the controller's
    ``CreditIssuer``. This avoids sensitivity to NTP step corrections mid-benchmark.
