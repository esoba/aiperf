"""Sticky credit router with fair load balancing.

Routes credits to workers: sticky routing for multi-turn sessions,
least-loaded selection for first turns. Lock-free via asyncio serialization.

Terminology:
    session: A unique execution of a conversation template, identified by
        x_correlation_id (UUID). All turns in a session route to the same worker.
    conversation_id: Template ID from the dataset (can be reused across sessions).

Includes:

class StickyCreditRouter(CommunicationMixin):
    """Routes credits to workers with sticky sessions and fair load balancing.

    All messages between the Worker and TimingManager service flow through the CreditRouter.

    IMPORTANT:
        - This class has been highly optimized for performance, as it is a hot path.
        - Please be careful when making changes to ensure performance is not degraded.
        - All operations are atomic because there are no await calls between reads and writes.
        - Methods are intentionally large/inlined to avoid function call overhead in the hot path.
        - The class is designed for single-threaded asyncio use only.

    Credit Routing:
        - First turn → least-loaded worker (creates sticky session).
        - Subsequent turns → same worker via sticky session lookup.
        - Final turn → cleanup sticky session.

    Load Balancing:
        - Least-loaded worker selection for new sessions using fair load balancing
            - Determined by the worker(s) with the fewest in-flight credits.
        - Tie-breaking for multiple workers in this order:
            - `active_sessions`: Prefer workers with fewer committed multi-turn sessions
            - `virtual_sent_credits`: Prefer workers with fewer historical credits (virtual to handle
                late-joining workers fairly - they start at average, not zero)
            - `last_sent_at_ns`: Prefer workers with oldest send time (LRU-like fairness)

    Credit Returns:
        - All CreditReturns and FirstTokens flow through the CreditRouter and
          are forwarded via callbacks that are directly awaited for responsiveness.

    Lock-free:
        - Ensure there are no await calls in critical paths.

    Hot path complexity:
        - sticky session lookup is O(1)
        - min load tracking/lookup is O(1)
        - load balancing for new sessions is O(k) where k = workers tied at min load
        - credit sent/returned tracking is O(1)

    Cold path complexity:
        - worker register/unregister is O(n) where n = number of workers
        - credit cancellation is O(n × k) where n = number of workers, k = average in-flight credits per worker
